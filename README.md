# **AI/ML-Based Cryptographic Algorithm Identification**

Welcome to the repository for the **AI/ML-Based Cryptographic Algorithm Identification** project! This project was developed as part of a hackathon with the goal of creating an intelligent system capable of identifying cryptographic algorithms from modern cryptographic datasets. By leveraging AI and ML techniques, the system analyzes data patterns and features to determine the cryptographic algorithm used, automating the process and enhancing the understanding of algorithm weaknesses to improve security.
